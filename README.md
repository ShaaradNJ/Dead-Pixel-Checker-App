# dead_pixel_checker_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

PixelChecker is a simple yet highly useful Flutter app designed to help users check for dead or under-glowing pixels on their screens. The app displays solid colors such as red, green, blue, and black, enabling users to easily identify any pixel issues.

1) RGB Color Display: Toggle between solid red, green, and blue screens to pinpoint dead or under-glowing pixels. These primary colors help highlight any discrepancies on the screen.

2) Black Color Display: A black screen can reveal stuck pixels that may not be visible on colored backgrounds. It's particularly useful for identifying pixels stuck on a single color.

3) User-Friendly Interface: The app's clean and intuitive design ensures that users of all technical levels can navigate and use it without any hassle.

4) Portability: Lightweight and fast, PixelChecker is perfect for on-the-go testing. Whether you're buying a new device, selling an old one, or simply maintaining your current screen, PixelChecker is your go-to tool.
